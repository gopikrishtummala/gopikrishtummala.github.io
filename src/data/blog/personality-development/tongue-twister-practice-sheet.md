# Tongue Twister Practice Sheet — Clarity and Fluency for Tech Talks

Consistent articulation practice is one of the quickest ways to upgrade how you sound in demos, stakeholder reviews, or conference talks. Use this sheet as a repeatable warm-up: build muscle memory for crisp consonants, smooth pacing, and confident projection.

## 📅 Session Log

| Date | Time Spent | Focus Sounds |

## 🔥 Part 1: Daily Warm-Up (≈5 minutes)

Say each twist **slowly five times** to lock in clarity, then **faster five times** to build agility. Log a self-rating from 1️⃣ (muddy) to 5️⃣ (crystal clear).

| Focus Area | Tongue Twister | Clarity Score (1–5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S / Sh distinction (tip-to-palate control) | She sells seashells by the seashore. | /5 |
| T / D precision (ending consonants) | Two tiny toads tried to trot to Timbuktu. | /5 |
| P / B clarity (lip pop) | Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. | /5 |
| W / V distinction (lip vs. teeth) | Willie's really weary. | /5 |

## 🎯 Part 2: Targeted Articulation Drills

Use this grid to focus on sounds that typically blur together when you present. Add your own notes about what caught you off guard.

| Focus Sound | Drill / Phrase | Practice Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R ↔ L transitions | Red lorry, yellow lorry. | |
| TH (tongue forward) | Thirty-three thick, thrilling thorns. | |
| Long vowels (open mouth) | I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream. | |
| Jaw agility | Unique New York. | |

## 📣 Part 3: Projection & Pacing Test

Bridge the warm-up to real meetings. Pick a 30-second summary from a current project (e.g., a sprint update or roadmap milestone).

| Step | Instructions | Score / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (A) Slow, deliberate delivery | Enunciate every syllable, exaggerating your mouth shape. | Pacing score: (Too fast / Just right / Too slow) |
| (B) Conversational delivery | Speak at your normal speed while projecting to someone across the room. | Projection score: (Strained / Supported / Full) |

> **Tip:** Record both takes on your phone. Play them back the next day to spot improvements and recurring muddiness.

## 🚀 Practice Tips

- **Mirror work:** Over-articulate in front of a mirror to reinforce tongue and jaw placement.
- **Micro sessions:** Even 2 minutes count—run one warm-up row and one projection drill whenever you have a gap.
- **Weekly review:** Keep your best self-recordings in a folder; compare week to week to track clarity and pacing gains.

Would an advanced sheet with higher-speed twisters help next week? Let me know—happy to draft a Level 2 module focused on long passages and rapid-fire consonant clusters.
