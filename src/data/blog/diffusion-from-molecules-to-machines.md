## 1. Diffusion in Nature

When you drop a bit of ink in water, the color spreads gradually until it looks uniform.  
This simple behavior is called **diffusion** — the random motion of particles that moves matter from regions of high concentration to low concentration.

Mathematically, diffusion is described by the **heat equation**:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 u
$$

Here $u$ is the quantity that diffuses (such as concentration or temperature), and $D$ is the **diffusion coefficient** controlling how fast it spreads.

Diffusion is everywhere: in heat conduction, chemical reactions, and molecular motion.  
It is a process of **information loss** — sharp details and differences blur over time.

## 2. Reverse Diffusion: Turning Noise Into Structure

Diffusion models in AI take this familiar physical process and **run it in reverse**.

The idea is simple but powerful:

1. Start with real data (like an image).  
2. Gradually add small amounts of random noise to it until it becomes pure noise.  
3. Train a neural network to **remove** that noise step by step — learning the reverse of diffusion.

The forward “noising” process can be written as:

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\alpha_t}\, \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

Here $x_0$ is the original data and $x_t$ is the noisy version after $t$ steps.

The model learns the reverse process — predicting $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$, the noise that was added — and subtracting it out to denoise.  
Repeating this over 20–1000 steps turns random noise into a realistic sample.

Conceptually, this means:  
> **Forward diffusion destroys information; reverse diffusion reconstructs it.**

That reconstruction is what enables diffusion models to *generate* images, sounds, or molecular structures from scratch.

## 3. Guided Diffusion: Steering the Generation

A standard diffusion model learns to produce samples that simply “look realistic.”  
But often we want to **control** what it generates — for example:
- an image of a “cat sitting on grass,”  
- a driving scenario with a “pedestrian crossing,” or  
- a protein that “binds to a given molecule.”

This is achieved using **guided diffusion** — a way to bias or steer the reverse process toward a specific goal.

### 3.1 Classifier Guidance

One approach uses an external classifier that estimates how likely a partially denoised image matches a desired label $y$.

At each step, we modify the reverse process to favor samples with high classifier probability $p_\phi(y | x_t)$:

$$
\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_{t-1} | x_t, y)
= \nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_{t-1} | x_t)
+ s \, \nabla_{x_t} \log p_\phi(y | x_t)
$$

The term $s$ controls **guidance strength**:
- $s = 0$: unguided, purely realistic samples  
- large $s$: stronger conditioning, but less variety

The second term acts like a **force** pulling the diffusion trajectory toward samples matching the condition.

---

### 3.2 Classifier-Free Guidance

A simpler and widely used method (e.g. in **Stable Diffusion**) is to train a single model that can operate both with and without conditioning.

During sampling, we combine the two modes:

$$
\hat{\epsilon} = (1 + w) \, \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, y)
- w \, \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)
$$

Here $w$ is again a **guidance scale**.  
Higher values make the generation follow the prompt more strictly, at the cost of diversity.

This method requires no separate classifier and is more efficient.  
It can condition on many things: text, semantic maps, or robot states.

## 4. Diffusion as Gradient Flow in Probability Space

Diffusion can also be viewed as a **probabilistic process** — a kind of random walk in data space.

In continuous form, it is described by a **stochastic differential equation (SDE)**.  
The reverse diffusion then follows another SDE with an extra term that points toward areas of higher probability (the **score function**).

Guidance simply modifies this score, adding an extra gradient that shifts the flow toward samples consistent with the desired condition.  
Intuitively, every denoising step becomes a small, directed move through probability space.

## 5. Applications

### 5.1 Vision and Text-to-Image

Models like **Stable Diffusion** and **Imagen** apply diffusion in a compact “latent” space — a lower-dimensional version of the image learned by an autoencoder.  
Guidance from text embeddings allows semantic control over generation, producing accurate and coherent results from natural language prompts.

### 5.2 Robotics and Planning

In robotics, diffusion models generate *trajectories* rather than images.  
Each trajectory represents a sequence of robot actions or positions.  
By denoising noisy trajectories, models like **Diffusion Policy** produce smooth, physically consistent motions.  
At Zoox, **Scenario Diffusion** uses the same principle to generate rare but safety-critical driving situations for simulation and planning.

### 5.3 Biology and Molecular Design

In biology, the “data” consists of 3D protein structures.  
**RFdiffusion** from the Baker Lab learns how real proteins vary under noise, then reverses that process to create new stable folds.  
It treats atoms like pixels — denoising random coordinates into functional molecular shapes.

## 6. Why Diffusion Matters

| Aspect | Diffusion Models | Guided Diffusion |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Goal | Model data distribution | Model conditional distribution |
| Mechanism | Denoising via score learning | Denoising with directional bias |
| Output | Diverse, realistic samples | Controlled, goal-driven samples |
| Examples | Unconditional image or sound generation | Text-to-image, motion planning, protein design |

Diffusion models stand out for three main reasons:

- **Stability:** Training involves predicting noise, a well-behaved and easy-to-learn target.  
- **Grounding in physics:** They are directly inspired by stochastic processes in nature.  
- **General applicability:** The same principle works across very different domains — pixels, trajectories, or molecules.

## 7. Summary

- **Diffusion** describes how randomness spreads — in physics, it smooths out differences.  
- **Reverse diffusion** teaches AI systems to go the other way — turning noise into order.  
- **Guided diffusion** adds control, steering this process toward specific goals.

From generating lifelike images to planning robot motions and designing proteins, diffusion has become a **unifying principle**:  
a bridge between randomness and creativity, between physics and intelligence.
